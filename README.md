# Object Oriented Programming

**Object Oriented Programming** System is the programming technique to write programs based on the real world objects. The states and behaviors of an object are represented as the *member variables* and *methods*. In OOPS programming programs are organized around objects and data rather than actions and logic.

## Advantages

Major advantages of OOPS programming are :

1. **Simplicity:** OOPS programming objects model real world objects, so the complexity is reduced and the program structure is clear.
2. **Modularity:** Each object forms a separate entity whose internal workings are decoupled from other parts of the system.
3. **Modifiability:** It is easy to make minor changes in the data representation or the procedures in an OO program. Changes inside a class do not affect any other part of a program, since the only public interface that the external world has to a class is through the use of methods.
4. **Extensibility:** Adding new features or responding to changing operating environments can be solved by introducing a few new objects and modifying some existing ones.
5. **Maintainability:** Objects can be maintained separately, making locating and fixing problems easier.
6. **Reusability:** Objects can be reused in different programs.

## Core concepts

OOPS core concepts are;

1. *Abstraction*
2. *Encapsulation*
3. *Polymorphism*
4. *Inheritance*
5. *Composition*
6. *Association*
7. *Aggregation*

Every properties will be described in the specific folder
