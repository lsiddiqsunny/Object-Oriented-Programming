# Object

A Java object is a combination of **data and procedures** working on the available data. An object has a **state and behavior**. The state of an object is stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions) display the object's behavior. Objects are created from templates known as classes. In Java, an object is created using the keyword **"new"**.

An object has three characteristics:

**State:** represents the data (value) of an object.

**Behavior:** represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.

**Identity:** An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID. The value of the ID is not
visible to the external user. However, it is used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely.

There are **three steps** to creating a Java object:

1. Declaration of the object
2. Instantiation of the object
3. Initialization of the object

Example : [Objects](../Java/src/Dog.java)

## Cloning object

Object can be created by **cloning**.
The object cloning is a way to create exact copy of an object. The **clone() method** of Object class is used to clone an object.

**The java.lang.Cloneable** interface must be implemented by the class whose object clone we want to create. If we don't implement Cloneable interface, clone() method generates **CloneNotSupportedException**.

## Anonymous object

Whenever an object is instantiated but is not assigned a reference variable, it is called **anonymous object instantiation**.

Simple object instantiation:

     Sample s = new Sample();

Anonymous object instantiation:

     new Sample();

The anonymous object is created and dies **instantaneously**. But, still  with anonymous objects work can be extracted before it dies like calling a method using the anonymous object:

     new Sample().display()

The anonymous object can be used only once in the program.We canâ€™t use  twice or more as the anonymous object dies immediately after doing its assigned task.

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
